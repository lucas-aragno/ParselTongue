(here is a cool guide (**spanish**): http://lingwars.github.io/blog/instalar-python-en-windows-7.html)

## OSX
*If you have homebrew installed just run:*
```
$ brew install python
```

## Linux
*You Might have already python installed, try:*
```

```


## Once you have python up and running:
*Go to the file that you wanna run and execute:*
